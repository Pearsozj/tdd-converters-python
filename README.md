# Units Conversion Library following TDD with Python

It's really important early on in your coding career to instill GOOD habits like writing unit tests. TDD, or test-driven development, is the process of starting by writing a failing test, then writing just enough code to make it pass, then refactoring it until it is correct, well-tested, and well-formatted before going on to the next part of your program.

This repo contains the skeleton for a project including basic tests. In order to use it, follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Open it up in VSCode
3. From the terminal, create a virtual environment
4. Activate it
5. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the tests with `pytest`
7. Alternatively, run tests continuously with `ptw`
8. Iteratively update your code, uncommenting the tests as you go until they all pass
